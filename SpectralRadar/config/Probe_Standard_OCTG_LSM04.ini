## Factors to calculate the voltage for the scanner from the position of the scan pattern in mm
# Linear factor for the x-axis in V / mm
FactorX = 0.538999
# Offset for the x-axis in V
OffsetX = 6.94642e-05
# Linear factor for the y-axis in V / mm
FactorY = 0.572297
# Offset for the y-axis in V
OffsetY = 0.0176988

# The offset of the reference stage in mm
ReferenceStageOffset_mm = 40

## The following parameters influence only the scan pattern (camera overlay) and valid scan range.
## To change the settings for the video camera image use the VideoCamera-entries below.
# The px/mm ratio in x-direction
CameraScalingX = 32.3351
# The px/mm ratio in y-direction
CameraScalingY = 32.3402
# Angle between the coordinate system of the scanner and video camera
CameraAngle = 89.7612
# Polynomial coefficients (15 values) for the 2D-polynomial of degree 4 which is used for the image field correction
# Array with no default entry. If not found, look for ImageField.dat in configPath(historical reason)

# Choose the kind of scan pattern connection : Polynomial6(default), Polynomial4, Exponential
# Polynomial6 : polynomial of order 6
# Polynomial4 : polynomial of order 4
# Exponential : a smooth connection to the(scan) start, but a hard connection at the(scan) end.This was used in versions < 5.2.
# this entry is ignored for the MEMS probe right now
