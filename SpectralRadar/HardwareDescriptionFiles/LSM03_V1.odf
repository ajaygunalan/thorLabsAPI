# Description file for objective LSM03, Version 1 (December 2017)

# Name that will be displayed in the graphics user interface [LK2, ..., LSM02, LSM03, ..., Custom] and the version [V1, V2,...]
# Quotation marks used to prevent WPF from reformating.
Objective_DisplayName = "LK3/LSM03(-BB) V1"

# Max scan range (mm)
RangeMaxX = 10        # mm
RangeMaxY = 10        # mm

# Focal length is not the working distance. Check https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2910
ObjectiveFocalLength = 36      # mm

# The mount specification will be used to find the compatible probes. It should be something like "M25x0.75", or "M14x0.5". 
# Empty spaces and uppercase will be ignored: " M14 x 0.5" is here the same as "m14x0.5"
ObjectiveMount = M25x0.75

# Optical path length, in millimeter (without counting the focal length, multiplied by the equivalent refractive index)
ObjectiveOpticalPathLength = 20
